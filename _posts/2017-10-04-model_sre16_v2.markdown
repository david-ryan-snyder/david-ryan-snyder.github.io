title:  "NIST SRE 2016 Xvector Recipe"
date:   2017-10-04 00:14:28 -0400
---
We added our version of DNN speaker embeddings to the main branch of [Kaldi][kaldi].
We're releasing it with a "bare bones" NIST SRE 2016 recipe to demonstrate the system.
See the [pull request][xvector-pr] for more details.

The system, built for speaker recognition, consists of a feedforward DNN with a statistics pooling layer.
It is trained to classify a list of speakers using a multiclass cross entropy objective.
In the future, this will probably be extended to include "same vs different" training.
After training, the last few layers of the network are removed,
and variable-length utterances are mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings that are used in a PLDA backend (like ivectors).
We're calling these embeddings "xvectors" in Kaldi speaker recognition recipes.
This is based on [Deep Neural Network Embeddings for Text-Independent Speaker Verification][interspeech2017]
but includes recent enhancements not found in that paper, such as data augmentation.
Look for a more up-to-date paper describing this system in ICASSP 2018.

Pretrained Model
--------
We're releasing a pretrained model on kaldi-asr.org [here][pretrained-model].

The tar.gz contains files generated from the recipe in egs/sre16/v2/.
It's contents should be placed in a similar directory, with access to
sid/, steps/, etc. This was created when the Kaldi master branch was at git
log [e082c17d4a8f8a791428ae4d9f7ceb776aef3f0b][commit-id].

# Results

The models should produce results similar to this on SRE16.
The acoustic ivector system is included for reference (see egs/sre16/v1).
Note that the PLDA backend used here is still fairly basic.  Results for both
the ivector and xvector systems will improve with more sophisticated adaptation
and score normalization.
```
  xvector              EER: Pooled 8.57%, Tagalog 12.29%, Cantonese 4.89%
  ivector (from ../v1) EER: Pooled 12.98%, Tagalog 17.8%, Cantonese 8.35%
```
