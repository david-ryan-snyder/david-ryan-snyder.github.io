title:  "NIST SRE 2016 Xvector Recipe"
date:   2017-10-04 00:14:28 -0400

The DNN speaker embeddings are now supported in the main branch of [Kaldi][kaldi]{:target="_blank"}.
We've also added a "bare bones" NIST SRE 2016 recipe to demonstrate the system.
See the [pull request][xvector-pr]{:target="_blank"} for more details.

The system, built for speaker recognition, consists of a TDNN with a statistics pooling layer.
It's trained to classify a list of speakers using a multiclass cross entropy objective.
In the future, this will probably be extended to include "same vs different" training.
After training, the last few layers of the network are removed,
and variable-length utterances are mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings that are used in a PLDA backend (like ivectors).
We're calling these embeddings "xvectors" in Kaldi speaker recognition recipes.
This is based on ["X-vectors: Robust DNN Embeddings for Speaker Recognition"][ICASSP2018]{:target="_blank"} which
was persented at ICASSP 2018.

Pretrained Model
--------
We've uploaded a pretrained model on [kaldi-asr.org][pretrained-model]{:target="_blank"}.

The archive 0003_sre16_v2_1a.tar.gz contains files generated from the recipe in egs/sre16/v2/.
It's contents should be placed in a similar directory, with symbolic links to
sid/, steps/, etc. This was created when the Kaldi master branch was at git
log [e082c17d4a8f8a791428ae4d9f7ceb776aef3f0b][commit-id]{:target="_blank"}.

# Results

The models should produce results similar to the following on SRE16.
The acoustic ivector system is included for reference (see egs/sre16/v1).
Note that the PLDA backend used here is still fairly basic.  Results for both
the ivector and xvector systems will improve with more sophisticated adaptation
and score normalization.
```
  xvector              EER: Pooled 8.57%, Tagalog 12.29%, Cantonese 4.89%
  ivector (from ../v1) EER: Pooled 12.98%, Tagalog 17.8%, Cantonese 8.35%
```
