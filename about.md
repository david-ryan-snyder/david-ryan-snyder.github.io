<img alt="" width="230" height="230" class="avatar width-full rounded-2" src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5439976?s=460&amp;v=4"> I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department and the <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at the Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore, Maryland.
<a href="http://www.danielpovey.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Povey</a> and <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev" target="_blank">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> co-advise my research, which focuses on discriminatively trained representations for speaker recognition, spoken language recognition, and speaker diarization.
I also collaborate with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dgromeroweb/" target="_blank">Daniel Garcia-Romero</a>, <a href="https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/faculty/greg-sell/" target="_blank">Gregory Sell</a> and <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/affiliated-faculty/alan-mccree-2" target="_blank">Alan McCree</a> of the <a href="https://hltcoe.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Human Language Technology Center of Excellence</a>.
I am a co-inventor of x-vectors, the first state-of-the-art neural embedding for text-independent speaker recognition.
As a <a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/graphs/contributors">contributor</a> to the <a href="http://kaldi-asr.org" target="_blank">Kaldi toolkit</a>, I develop and maintain the speaker recognition and diarization systems.
My industry experience in speech processing includes internships at Amazon Alexa and ICF International as well as consulting with Spoken Communications.
I am a recipient of the 2013 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, which partially supports my research at JHU.
Before coming to Baltimore, I received a BS in Computer Science from Portland State University.
